# Diamond-Price-Prediction
Due to the limited supply and high demand, diamonds have become luxury items and the prices for them are set high. However, not
all diamonds are equal and some are considerably more costly compared to the other diamonds. Therefore, before purchasing, some people might need more accurate evaluation of diamonds
and whether the price is reasonable. In our study, we would like to examine the different features of diamond that affect its price and will implement a linear regression model that will predict the
price of the diamond.

In terms of accuracy, our method outperformed the current solution on Kaggle by 2.27% .
